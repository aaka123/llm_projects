India is a nation of immense diversity, ancient history, and dynamic modernity, serving as the world's most populous country and largest democracy. Its history spans over five millennia, marked by various empires and the birth of major religions.

The story begins with the Indus Valley Civilization (circa 2500-1900 BCE), followed by the Vedic Period (circa 1500-500 BCE) which saw the foundations of Hinduism and the emergence of Buddhism and Jainism. Classical empires like the Maurya Empire (322-185 BCE), under Ashoka the Great, unified much of the subcontinent and promoted Buddhism. The Gupta Empire (circa 320-550 CE) is considered India's "Golden Age," known for advancements in science, mathematics, art, and literature.

The medieval period brought Islam to India, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate (1206-1526 CE) and later the Mughal Empire (1526-1857 CE), renowned for its artistic and architectural brilliance, including the Taj Mahal. Sikhism also emerged during this time.

From the 17th century, European trading companies, particularly the British East India Company, gained dominance, leading to direct British Crown rule by the mid-19th century (the British Raj). This period saw infrastructure development but also economic exploitation. A powerful nationalist movement, led by Mahatma Gandhi and his nonviolent resistance, secured India's independence on August 15, 1947, though it was accompanied by the partition into India and Pakistan and widespread communal violence.
