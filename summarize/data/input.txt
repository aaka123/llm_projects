A revolution is brewing in the world of computation, one that promises to solve some of humanity's most complex problems in science, medicine, and finance. This revolution is powered by quantum computers, machines that operate on the bizarre and counterintuitive principles of quantum mechanics. However, this incredible power comes with a monumental threat: the ability to break the very cryptographic systems that protect our digital lives, from online banking and secure communications to national security secrets. This looming "quantum apocalypse" has ignited a global race among cryptographers to build a new generation of defenses, a field known as post-quantum cryptography (PQC), before the quantum sword falls
